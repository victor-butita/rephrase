Rephrase AI â€“ Text Analysis & Enhancement Suite
Rephrase AI is a modern, web-based text improvement platform built in Go, designed to help refine, verify, and perfect written content.
It leverages the Google Gemini API to offer three powerful capabilities:

Humanize Robotic Text â€“ Transform AI-like or stiff prose into natural, human-like writing.

Detect AI-Generated Content â€“ Estimate the likelihood that text was produced by AI.

Check for Plagiarism â€“ Identify potential matches from public internet sources.

This project is a full-stack demo featuring a Go backend and a dynamic vanilla JavaScript frontend.

Tip: Replace the placeholder screenshot with one from your running app â€“ itâ€™s your READMEâ€™s most eye-catching element.

âœ¨ Features
Multi-Functional Interface
Humanize â€“ Rewrite stiff or AI text with adjustable tone and complexity.

Detect AI â€“ Display a live gauge showing the likelihood of AI generation.

Check Plagiarism â€“ Provide a detailed source report of online matches.

Polished User Experience
Live word counter (200-word cap to optimize API usage)

Responsive dark-mode UI

Clear loading states and robust error handling

Robust Go Backend
Resilient API client â€“ Retries failed API calls with exponential backoff

Clean project structure â€“ Organized into cmd/, internal/handlers, internal/services

Secure configuration â€“ API keys stored in environment variables, never hardcoded

ðŸš€ Why Rephrase AI?
As AI-generated content becomes more common, the need to refine and verify text is greater than ever.
Rephrase AI showcases:

API Integration â€“ Uses Google Gemini for advanced text processing

REST API Design â€“ Single clean endpoint /api/process for all actions

Concurrency & Error Handling â€“ Graceful recovery from network/API failures

Full-Stack Development â€“ Go backend + vanilla JS frontend for a seamless experience
